The `template3` docker example calls `script.sh` as `ENTRYPOINT` 
and have a mounting point to a host directory.

### Purpose
* run bash scripts (`script.sh`)
* read, store, process data on a host directory via a mounting point.

Use the following commands to install, start, or uninstall the images or container.

| command | description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
| `./config uninstall` | Cleanup previous installations |
| `vi config.conf` | Increment the version |
| `./config.sh build run` | Build the Image and instantiate the Container |
| `./config.sh start` | Start the Container again |

Requires execution rights for `config.sh`.
For example, run `chmod u+x config.sh` to call `./config.sh ...`.
Otherwise call `bash config.sh ...`.


### script.sh
Contains code called by `ENTRYPOINT`.
